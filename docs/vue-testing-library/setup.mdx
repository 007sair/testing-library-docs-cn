`Vue Testing Library` does not require any configuration to be used.

### Cleanup

#### Jest

[`cleanup`](./api#cleanup) will be called after each test automatically for
Jest, so normally you don't need to change anything.

#### Vitest

Add `globals: true` to your `test` section of your vite config file to ensure we
can access `afterEach` to do the cleanup.
